Hull and Void is a run-based cooperative action game where players form a crew of pirates piloting and maintaining their spaceship as it travels sector to sector, encountering other ships, exploring abandoned stations filled with loot to acquire and trade.

Each player embodies their own pirate, and along with friends over a networked multiplayer session, crews a single spaceship from a first-person perspective. The pirate crew is tasked with walking the halls of the ship to maintain and operate its equipment and resources, warp jumping between procedurally generated sectors on a system map seeking to fulfil a selected overarching objective.

Within each sector is an encounter which could be an abandoned space station filled with loot, traps and hostile pirates, another ship waiting in ambush or a neutral station with merchants looking to trade. The player crew need to navigate these encounters together using their ship and its weapons, boarding and exploring stations on foot with what weapons and equipment they can muster or through dialogue with the non-player characters.

After overcoming the challenge of the sector, the crew jump their ship into the warp sea, a safe zone where they can organise and plan their next warp jump, and repeat the process until they either fulfil the objective, or are destroyed.

Outside of the gameplay run, every player has a profile where they accumulate doubloons by completing runs, which they can spend to customise their character and unlock equipment or different run scenarios.
